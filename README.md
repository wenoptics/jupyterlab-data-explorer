# JupyterLab Data Explorer

![Stability Experimental][badge-stability] [![npm][badge-npm-version-dataregistry-extension]][npm-package-dataregistry-extension] [![npm][badge-npm-version-dataregistry]][npm-package-dataregistry]

To experiment with the extension in a live notebook environment,

-   latest release (stable version): [![Binder (stable)][badge-binder]][binder-stable]
-   latest master (bleeding edge): [![Binder (latest)][badge-binder]][binder-master]

## Overview

-   Bring any data type you can imagine! **Extensible** and **type safe** data registry system.
-   Register **conversions** between the different data types.
-   Data changing on you? Use [`RxJS` **observables**][rxjs] to represent data over time.
-   Have a new way to look at your data? Create **React** or **lumino** components to view a certain type.
-   Built-in data **explorer UI** to find and use available datasets.
-   Dataset in your dataset? Use the **nested** datatype.
-   Building another data centric application? Use the [`@jupyterlab/dataregistry`][npm-package-dataregistry] package which can be used independently of [JupyterLab][jupyterlab].
-   Check out the project vision in the ["Press Release from the Future"](./press_release.md)!

## Prerequisites

When used as a [JupyterLab][jupyterlab] extension,

-   [JupyterLab][jupyterlab] (version >= 1.0.0)

## Installation

```bash
$ jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/dataregistry-extension
```

## Usage

[Usage docs](./docs/usage.md)

## Contributing

This repository is in active development, and we welcome collaboration. For development guidance, please consult the [development guide](./docs/development.md).

If you have ideas or questions, feel free to open an issue, or, if you feel like getting your hands dirty, feel free to tackle an existing issue by contributing a pull request.

We try to keep the current issues relevant and matched to relevant milestones.

### Third Party Extenson

You can either add support by adding a new converter to this repository or creating a new [JupyterLab][jupyterlab] extension that depends on the `IRegistry` exposed by this extension. You can access a `Registry`, which you can use to add your own converter.

It might also be useful to view the existing data types by looking at the source code in this repository and by using the debugger. You can open this in [JupyterLab][jupyterlab] by looking for the "Data Debugger" command:
